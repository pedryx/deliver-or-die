# About
Deliver or Die is an action-packed game that puts players in the shoes of a brave delivery person in a dangerous post-apocalyptic world. Your goal is to navigate through hazardous environments and battle enemies to deliver packages to target locations (gray circles) while constantly upgrading your skills to keep up with the increasing difficulty.

The game features a simple yet challenging gameplay mechanic where you must deliver packages on time, with the direction towards the next target location symbolized by a yellow arrow. With each successful delivery, you can upgrade one of your skills, including damage, move speed, reload time, shooting speed, max health, or you could just heal yourself.

As you progress through the game, the difficulty increases rapidly, making it challenging to survive against an increasing number of zombies and other hazards. So, be careful and use your skills wisely to stay alive as long as possible.

The gameâ€™s controls are simple and easy to master, with the WASD keys used for movement, R for reloading, and LMB for shooting.
